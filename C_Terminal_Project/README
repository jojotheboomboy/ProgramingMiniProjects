This was a program made to emulate a terminal. Was the final project for CSC 222.

FUNCTION printARGS
    Used for debugging purposes
    Not used in final code
    Prints the list of arguments

FUNCTION changeCWD
    Changes the curent working directory
    Includes error check
    Is called if cd is seen

FUNCTION exe
    This takes the given command and arguments to 
    execute via execvp in the child
    Includes error check


Within MAIN FUNCTION

SECTION 1
    Variable set up

SECTION 2
    Starts infinite loop
    Print out the command line and wait for an input
    tokenizes the first string by " "
    Sets up varibales for the next sections

SECTION 3
    Handles the built-in support commands
        pwd, cd, and exit

SECTION 4 A
    This section starts if the initial token is not
    a built-in support operator

    It tokenizes all the arguments into a list of 
    strings called args

    It also checks to see if any argument is a call
    for piping input or output
        Our piping is not working currently

SECTION 4 B
    Handles outlier conditions
        Removes "/n" from arguments
        Adds NULL if not already there
            This one happens with piping
    
    Uses the exe FUNCTION to execute the command
    
ERRORS
    Redirection
        -It does the command properly and uses the right arguments,
        however when it is used the program will put the first charater of
        the first argument into the output line twice and crash the program
